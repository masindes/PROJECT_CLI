# **Patient Management System **
Overview

The Patient Management System is a Python-based application that allows users to manage doctors and patients in a healthcare setting. This system interacts with an SQLite database to store doctor and patient information, and provides functionality to add, update, delete, and view details of doctors and patients. It uses SQLAlchemy for ORM (Object Relational Mapping) and terminaltables for displaying data in a tabular format in the terminal.
